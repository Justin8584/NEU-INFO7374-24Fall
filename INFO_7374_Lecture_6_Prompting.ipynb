In prompt engineering, the \"inputs\" are the carefully crafted prompts or questions fed to a language model, aimed at eliciting specific responses or behaviors. This is akin to hand-tuning the weights in a neural network, where the \"weights\" are adjusted to optimize the network's performance on a task. Both practices require a deep understanding of the system's workings and a trial-and-error approach to refine the inputs or parameters for optimal results."

However, CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always \"(A)\"--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers.\n"

        "- Idea: Manually modify the reasoning and see how it influences the answer\n",
        "- Result: Sometimes it affects the answer, and sometimes it does not. And as LMs become larger, they use the reasoning less\n",
        "- Methods to test the faithfulness of CoT reasoning\n",
        "    - **Early Answering**: Here, we truncate the CoT reasoning and force the model to \"answer early\" to see if it fully relies upon all of its stated reasoning to get to its final answer. If it is able to reach the same answer with less than the entirety of its reasoning, that's a possible sign of unfaithful reasoning.\n",
        "    - **Adding Mistakes**: Here, we add a mistake to one of the steps in a CoT reasoning sample and then force the model to regenerate the rest of the CoT. If it reaches the same answer with the corrupted reasoning, this is another sign of unfaithful reasoning.\n",
        "    - **Paraphrasing**: We swap the CoT for a paraphrase of the CoT and check to see if this changes the model answer. Here, a change in the final answer is actually a sign of unfaithful reasoning.\n",
        "    - **Filler Tokens**: Finally, we test to see if the additional test-time computation used when generating CoT reasoning is entirely responsible for the performance gain granted by CoT. We test this by replacing the CoT with an uninformative sequence (one filled with \"...\" tokens) of the same length to see if the model can reach the same final answer. If it can, this is another sign of unfaithful reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Overall, we find that the model's final answer is most sensitive to perturbations in the CoT reasoning for logical reasoning tasks (AQuA and LogiQA) and least sensitive for tests of crystallized knowledge (ARC and OpenBookQA), suggesting the reasoning is more like posthoc rationalization on those evaluations on the model we tested.\n",
        "- **Inverse Scaling in Reasoning Faithfulness**: As models increase in size and capability, the faithfulness of their reasoning decreases for most tasks we studied. In cases where reasoning faithfulness is important (e.g., high-stakes scenarios), using smaller models may help to provide additional transparency into how models are solving the task.\n",
